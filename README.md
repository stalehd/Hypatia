Hypatia
=======

Javascript library with ... stuff. Yes. Another one.

This one is made by me though. And that makes it special. Very special.

There's no overall theme to what will go into this library (or even if it gets
expanded with more stuff) but the overall theme will be "whatever I want to."

Why "Hypatia" you might ask -- well she's a notable librarian acccording to
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_librarians) and it is a nice
name. So there.
